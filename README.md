# DSA for Placements

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a fellow student preparing for placements, and I created this repository to track my progress while following the **Striver's SDE Sheet**.

Here, you'll find solutions to essential data structures and algorithms problems, solved using **C++**. Feel free to explore, practice, and learn along with me as we get ready for coding interviews and exams.

Happy learning and coding! ðŸ˜Š
