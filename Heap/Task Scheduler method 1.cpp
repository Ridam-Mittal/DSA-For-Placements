âœ… Approach 1: `n+1` Grouping (Using a Max Heap)
------------------------------------------------
- Greedy strategy: Always pick `n+1` most frequent tasks per cycle.
- Ensures different tasks fill the cooldown period.
- Efficient in minimizing idle time.
- This approach does NOT explicitly track cooldown but implicitly enforces it.

ðŸ”¹ Time Complexity: O(N log N) (heap operations)
ðŸ”¹ Space Complexity: O(N) (heap storage)

- The task that appeared the first time must have the highest freq count so even after the n+1 cycle ends the second most freq would also be able to maintain a gap of n b/w them as it will be the first most freq element again that comes after first cycle
